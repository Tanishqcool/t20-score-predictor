# t20-score-predictor
This project is a webapp made by streamlit framework on vscode IDE.The ML model is written in jupyter notebook.I have used XGBRegressor as the model.
The web app will take different inputs (same as input columns in dataset in notebook) and will give one output i.e. total score(of 1st innings).
